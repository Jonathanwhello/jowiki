        <h4>Boxing is a combat sport that involves two opponents throwing punches at each other in a regulated, timed environment. The origins of boxing date back to ancient civilizations, with the earliest forms seen in Egypt around 3000 BC. Modern boxing, as it’s known today, was formalized in the 18th century in England by Jack Broughton, often considered the “father of boxing,” who introduced rules and gloves to the sport. Later, the Marquess of Queensberry Rules in 1867 further shaped boxing into its current structure, with standardized rounds, gloves, and scoring systems. Boxing offers numerous benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased strength, enhanced hand-eye coordination, and greater mental discipline. Beyond physical fitness, boxing is known for its ability to boost confidence, reduce stress, and teach valuable self-defense skills. Today, boxing continues to grow globally, with a passionate fanbase and a range of professional and amateur competitions.</h4>

            <h4>
                <span>1. Jab</span>
                Description: A quick, straight punch with the lead hand (the hand closest to the opponent, typically 
                the left hand for right-handed boxers).
                Purpose: Used to maintain distance, gauge range, set up other punches, and keep the opponent off-balance.
                 It’s usually fast and helps establish control over the fight.
                
                <span>2. Cross</span>
                Description: A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand (the right hand for right-handed boxers),
                 crossing the body as it’s delivered.
                Purpose: Often follows a jab as a combination (jab-cross or "one-two"), serving as a power punch to create
                 impact or even to end a combination. It’s meant to exploit openings created by the jab.
                
                <span>3. Hook</span>
                Description: A semi-circular punch that targets the side of the opponent’s head or body, usually delivered
                 with the lead hand.
                Purpose: Hooks are highly effective at close range, often used to bypass an opponent’s guard or target their 
                vulnerable spots like the jaw or ribs. It can be used to catch the opponent off-guard, especially in combination
                 with other punches.
                
                <span>4. Uppercut</span>
                Description: A punch delivered in an upward motion, usually aimed at the opponent’s chin or torso.
                Purpose: Often used at close range, the uppercut can break through the opponent’s guard and cause significant
                 damage if it lands cleanly on the chin. It’s a powerful tool for knocking an opponent off-balance or disorienting
                  them.
                
                <span>5. Overhand</span>
                Description: A looping punch thrown from over the shoulder, usually with the rear hand.
                Purpose: Effective against opponents with a high guard, the overhand can break through by coming over the top of 
                the opponent’s gloves. This punch is often used to create surprise and generate power.
                
                <span>6. Body Shot</span>
                Description: A punch directed at the opponent’s torso, often targeting the ribs or solar plexus.
                Purpose: Body shots wear down the opponent’s stamina, making it harder for them to maintain their guard and stay 
                active in the later rounds. Body shots are less glamorous but very effective in weakening an opponent.
                
                <span>7. Check Hook</span>
                Description: A variation of the hook, often thrown while pivoting away from the opponent.
                Purpose: Used defensively to catch an advancing opponent while moving out of range. It helps create distance and 
                avoid getting cornered while also delivering a surprise counter-attack.
                
                <span>8. Lead Hook to the Body</span>
                Description: A hook aimed at the opponent’s liver or midsection, thrown with the lead hand.
                Purpose: Like other body shots, this punch weakens the opponent and can slow their movement. A well-placed hook to
                 the body can even end a fight if it lands on sensitive areas like the liver.
                Each of these attacks can be combined and varied to create a rhythm, openings, and pressure on the opponent. Mastery
                 of these punches, along with effective footwork and timing, allows a boxer to maintain control and adapt to different
                  opponents in the ring.</h4>
